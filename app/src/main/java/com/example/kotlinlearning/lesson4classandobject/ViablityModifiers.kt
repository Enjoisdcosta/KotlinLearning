/*
Everything is public by default
public- visable outside of the class
internal- means it will only be visible within that module. A module is a set of Kotlin files compiled together, for example, a library or application.
private- means it will only be visible in that class (or source file if you are working with functions).
protected- is the same as private, but it will also be visible to any subclasses.
